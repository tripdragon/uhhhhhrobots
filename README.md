#Basic questions and hypotheticals:

The following is based on the assumption that the space is the Mechanics hall.
Since its a public and historic space that can accept a large head count many overhead questions arise.

If instead we paired down and had the event at Bigroom as a typical offshoot of Hacknight we could forgo a lot of this.
So long as there is no large amount of soldering.

Or we can use these questions to formulate a future event instead and give ourselves a better stretch of time to organize properly.

#Start
Discussed previous show was a budget of roughly $300 What was the head count?
How many computers?
Did they provide their own?
How long did the show go?


#People:
Wanted head count?
How many robots per people?
How much per unit? The organizing team had a discount for a particular ardurio, ill recheck its data.
Is there an admission fee?

Do we divide people up in teams?
Raffle type divide, or would they bring a teammate?

What are people building? The same unit target or can they diverge?
What is the time to finish? 2 hours, 8 hours?
What is our locations time limit?
How do we keep people engaged if say it goes for 8 hours?
What’s the prize?

#Meta:
Parking, we discussed the Historic society off hours could lend theirs. What is the lot count?
Do we need a map to the place?
Insurance?
Restrooms work?
Does someone need to be present to lock the doors?
Who cleans up? How long of time given?

#Health:
If there’s soldering is there ventilation?
Even if there is ventilation this is a historic building do they allow electrical work?

Electrical equipment and safety gear. Floor mats, gloves visors, etc.
